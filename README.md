# BizCardX-Extracting-Business-Card-Data-with-OCR
# ABOUT
Bizcard is a Python application developed to streamline the extraction of essential information from business card images using Optical Character Recognition (OCR) technology. By integrating technologies like Python, EasyOCR, Streamlit, SQL, and Pandas, Bizcard offers a robust solution for automating the tedious task of manually inputting data from business cards.

Here's a breakdown of the key components and functionalities of Bizcard:

# Python:
Python serves as the primary programming language for developing the Bizcard application. Python's versatility, ease of use, and extensive libraries make it an ideal choice for implementing OCR and handling data processing tasks.

# EasyOCR:
EasyOCR is utilized as the OCR engine in Bizcard. EasyOCR is a lightweight and accurate OCR library built on top of PyTorch. It supports a wide range of languages and provides high accuracy in extracting text from images, making it suitable for processing business card images with varying layouts and fonts.

# Streamlit:
Streamlit is leveraged to create a user-friendly web interface for Bizcard. Streamlit allows developers to build interactive web applications directly from Python scripts, enabling users to upload business card images and view extracted information in real-time.

# SQL: 
SQL (Structured Query Language) is employed for database management within Bizcard. It enables the storage and retrieval of extracted business card data in a structured format, facilitating efficient data management and retrieval.

# Pandas:
Pandas is utilized for data manipulation and analysis tasks within Bizcard. It offers powerful data structures and functions for handling structured data, allowing users to perform various operations such as data cleaning, transformation, and analysis on the extracted business card data.

# Functionality-wise, Bizcard offers the following capabilities:

# Image Upload:
Users can upload business card images through the Streamlit interface.

# Text Extraction:
Bizcard employs EasyOCR to extract text from uploaded business card images.

# Data Processing:
Extracted text data is processed and structured into relevant fields such as name, designation, company, contact information, etc.

# Data Storage:
Processed data is stored in a SQL database for easy access and retrieval.
   
# Data Presentation: 
Users can view the extracted information from business cards via the Streamlit interface, allowing for quick verification and review.

Overall, Bizcard aims to streamline and automate the process of extracting key details from business card images, enhancing efficiency and accuracy in managing business card information.

# Result
In this project we can able to  extract text data ,Image data from business card and we can able to modify the details of the business card by using EASYOCR and for collected data storage I have used SQLLITE3.
